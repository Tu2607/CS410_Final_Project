# CS 410P: Computers, Sound, and Music Term Project
#### Playing Piano on Your Computer Keyboard
Angie McGraw, Tu Vu

##### About 
By using assigning traditional piano sound frequencies to the different keys of a computer keyboard, we aim to play music like we would on a typical piano. If possible, we aim to create a user interface where the user can visualize the audio that is being played or see the piano keys that they're hitting. 

There are about 101 keys on a traditional computer keyboard and 88 keys on a traditional piano, which corresponds to 7 octaves. We could either program 88 computer keys to do so, or we could pitch some keys to give us a broader range.

##### Features
We could record what the user is playing on their computer keys, so they can replay what they've created.

##### Programming Language
We will be using Python 3 for this project.
